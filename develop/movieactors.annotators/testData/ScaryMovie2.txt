Scary Movie 2 is a 2001 parody film. It is the second film of the Scary Movie franchise. Though part of the first Scary Movie's tagline read "...No sequel," this film's tagline compensated by adding "We lied".

The film parodies a range of horror-thriller movies, including The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror, Poltergeist, The Changeling, Hollow Man, The Legend of Hell House, and The Haunting.

The film currently stands as the last film in the series to star the Wayans siblings, and the last to be directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans.

Some of the original working titles were Scary Sequel and Scarier Movie.

Plot

The film opens with a parody of The Exorcist, during which teenager Megan Voorhees (Natasha Lyonne) becomes possessed by the spirit of Hugh Kane, the previous owner of the House. Two priests, Father McFeely (James Woods) and Father Harris (Andy Richter) attempt to drive Hugh's ghost out, but the exorcism does not go as planned, resulting in a chain of vomiting and various instances of pedophilia. Finally, McFeely responds to an insult towards his mother by shooting Megan.

One year later, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Shorty Meeks (Marlon Wayans) are at college, trying to live new lives following the events of the previous film (although most of them actually died in Scary Movie, Brenda claims in a deleted scene that her death was a near-death experience). Cindy and Brenda get tagged by a socially maladjusted girl, Alex (Tori Spelling). Ray, still confused about his sexuality, has two new male friends, Tommy (James DeBello) and Buddy (Christopher Masterson).

A charming yet lecherous teacher, Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paraplegic assistant, Dwight Hartman (David Cross), plan to study the paranormal activity at a local haunted mansion called Hell House using the clueless teens. Meanwhile, Buddy's advances are spurned by Cindy, who is recovering from her previous relationship.

When Cindy is the first to arrive at Hell House, she encounters a vulgar parrot (voice of Matt Friedman), and the caretaker, Hanson (Chris Elliott), who has a badly malformed hand. Later that evening, the group, including sexy newcomer Theo (Kathleen Robertson), sit down for dinner. Unfortunately, everybody loses their appetite due to Hanson's repulsive antics.

In the night, Cindy hears voices directing her to a secret room, where she and Buddy discover a treasure chest containing the diary of the wife of the house's dead owner, Hugh Kane. They also find an old portrait of the wife and note Cindy's resemblance to her. Meanwhile, many of the teens fall victim to violent attacks. Cindy gets involved in a fist fight with the house cat, Mr. Kittles. A toy clown attempts to kill Ray — but thanks to some quick thinking, Ray perversely turns the tables and rapes the clown. A weed-monster turns Shorty into a joint and tries to smoke him — fortunately, the plant gets distracted by munchies and lets him escape. The ghost of Hugh Kane (Richard Moll) has sex with Alex in her bedroom, yet departs in the morning when Alex expresses her interest in becoming the new Mrs. Kane.

Oldman is seduced and killed by the disfigured ghost of the murdered mistress. Shorty later encounters the same ghost, yet he seduces her instead. After Dwight equips the teens with weapons that can injure their spectral enemy, they are pursued throughout the mansion. Buddy and Cindy get locked in the refrigerator. Thinking that Buddy is dying from an encounter with the ghost, Cindy gives him a handjob. The couple then escape the room following a convoluted deus ex machina, in which Cindy uses a collection of random objects in the room to somehow produce a Caterpillar tractor, which she drives through the wall.

Hanson himself gets possessed by Kane. Cindy, Brenda, and Theo team up to fight him in a parody of Charlie's Angels, but wind up defeated. Eventually, Dwight and the teens regroup, and agree to use Cindy as bait to lure Kane into a device that will destroy him. Just as they activate the device, they realize Cindy is still standing on it. Ray springs to action and saves her. The plan succeeds, freeing the group from the house's curse.

Two months later, Cindy and Buddy are in a relationship and go out for a walk. However, Buddy disappears without notice when Cindy discovers Hanson at the hot dog stand. As Cindy backs away in fear, Hanson pursues her — and gets struck by a car driven by Shorty.

Parodies

This film parodies and references many other films of the horror, thriller and mystery genres.

    The film's central parody is The Haunting.
    The opening scene is modeled after The Exorcist.
    The equipment which they use to see the ghosts with glasses and weapons, referenced Thir13en Ghosts.
    Hollow Man – The equipment which the group employs to fight an invisible enemy (thermal goggles, smoke, and so on) and use of a defibrilator to escape from a freezer room.
    House on Haunted Hill – The labyrinthian basement, weapons with limited ammo, and Professor Oldman being lured to his death.
    Charmed - Hugh Kane's vanquishing is the same as many of the vanquishings the sisters do on the show.
    Brenda's reaction to the walking skeleton could be taken as commentary on the film's use of imagery no longer considered scary today.
    In the scene in which Hanson removes the top of Shorty's head and he then said "Hello Cindy", is similar to a scene in Hannibal.
    The scene where Ray and his friend reading their back tattoos to each other repeatedly, references to a scene of Dude, Where's My Car?.
    What Lies Beneath is parodied in a scene where Cindy seduces the professor in the kitchen, and then Ray suddenly appears in the same dress.
    In the scene in which a clown hides under Ray's bed and then pulls him underneath. The giant Marijuana plant is like the tree that comes to life and Alex being dragged across the walls of the bedroom, is also heavily a parody of Poltergeist.
    In the sequence where an invisible ghostly presence penetrates Alex and then has sex with her, heavily references Dracula and The Entity
    Poltergeist II – Hanson sings "God is in his holy temple" and the use of Kane as the name of the evil spirit.
    Stephen King's It is referenced in a scene in which the letters "IT" are written across a wall in the room where Shorty hides at the end of the movie. Interestingly, Tim Curry, who plays Professor Oldman, also played the role of Pennywise The Clown in the film adaptation of It.
    The Rocky Horror Picture Show – Hanson is a parody of the character, Riff Raff. Again, Tim Curry played the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
    Cindy, Brenda and Theo fighting Hanson in the style of Charlie's Angels. Also, Tori Spelling's character is named after Lucy Liu's character (Alex Munday) from the film and Tim Curry co-starred.
    Save the Last Dance – Shorty teaches Cindy how to be "black".
    Mission: Impossible II - The wheelchair duel between Dwight and Kane parody the motorcycle sequence between Ethan and Sean.
    MacGyver – Cindy uses everyday items to build a mini-bulldozer and escape the refrigerator.
    The Amityville Horror – Reverend McFeely tries to bless the house and ends up with flies all over him, only for the scene to change and reveal he is actually straining to defecate into a toilet.
    Buddy hands Cindy a book titled "Harry PotHead", a clear reference to Harry Potter.
    A scene where a basketball falls down the stairs is similar to The Changeling until the scene switches over to a parody of a Nike commercial.[1]
    Dawn of the Dead – Ray has on a suit similar to Peter's SWAT team suit.
    The dialogue between Cindy and Buddy in the freezer, when she is giving him a handjob has been taken from Titanic.
    The use of the quote 'Do You Feel Lucky Punk' from Dwight, is a parody of Dirty Harry.
    Twister – When Cindy is fighting Hanson and creates the tornado, which has various objects and even a cow blowing around inside it.
    Scanners – Hanson's head blows up.
    Rocky – Cindy's fight with the cat (editing style, blows, unseen cameras flashing and the cat's triumphant raising of its "fists").
    Weakest Link – When the parrot says "You are the weakest link. Goodbye" after Tori Spelling's character gets knocked out by the chandelier.
    The skeleton chasing Cindy sequence is based on from Wishmaster.
    The scene with Cindy singing badly along to the radio in the car then getting told to Shut Up by the radio could be a Parody of Urban Legend because the opening featured a woman singing along to the radio badly.
    The scene where Dwight and Hanson are trading insults about each other's disability is based on the scene from Wild Wild West where Jim West and Arliss Loveless trade insults on West's race and Loveless's disability.
    The scene when Cindy is fighting with the cat and the name of the house is from the movie The Legend of Hell House.
    Ray carrying the paraplegic Dwight on his back is reminiscent of Chewbacca attaching the destroyed C-3PO to a harness on his back in The Empire Strikes Back.
