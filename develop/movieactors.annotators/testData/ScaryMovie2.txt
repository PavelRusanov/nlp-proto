Parodies

This film parodies and references many other films of the horror, thriller and mystery genres.

    The film's central parody is The Haunting.
    The opening scene is modeled after The Exorcist.
    The equipment which they use to see the ghosts with glasses and weapons, referenced Thir13en Ghosts.
    Hollow Man – The equipment which the group employs to fight an invisible enemy (thermal goggles, smoke, and so on) and use of a defibrilator to escape from a freezer room.
    House on Haunted Hill – The labyrinthian basement, weapons with limited ammo, and Professor Oldman being lured to his death.
    Charmed - Hugh Kane's vanquishing is the same as many of the vanquishings the sisters do on the show.
    Brenda's reaction to the walking skeleton could be taken as commentary on the film's use of imagery no longer considered scary today.
    In the scene in which Hanson removes the top of Shorty's head and he then said "Hello Cindy", is similar to a scene in Hannibal.
    The scene where Ray and his friend reading their back tattoos to each other repeatedly, references to a scene of Dude, Where's My Car?.
    What Lies Beneath is parodied in a scene where Cindy seduces the professor in the kitchen, and then Ray suddenly appears in the same dress.
    In the scene in which a clown hides under Ray's bed and then pulls him underneath. The giant Marijuana plant is like the tree that comes to life and Alex being dragged across the walls of the bedroom, is also heavily a parody of Poltergeist.
    In the sequence where an invisible ghostly presence penetrates Alex and then has sex with her, heavily references Dracula and The Entity
    Poltergeist II – Hanson sings "God is in his holy temple" and the use of Kane as the name of the evil spirit.
    Stephen King's It is referenced in a scene in which the letters "IT" are written across a wall in the room where Shorty hides at the end of the movie. Interestingly, Tim Curry, who plays Professor Oldman, also played the role of Pennywise The Clown in the film adaptation of It.
    The Rocky Horror Picture Show – Hanson is a parody of the character, Riff Raff. Again, Tim Curry played the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
    Cindy, Brenda and Theo fighting Hanson in the style of Charlie's Angels. Also, Tori Spelling's character is named after Lucy Liu's character (Alex Munday) from the film and Tim Curry co-starred.
    Save the Last Dance – Shorty teaches Cindy how to be "black".
    Mission: Impossible II - The wheelchair duel between Dwight and Kane parody the motorcycle sequence between Ethan and Sean.
    MacGyver – Cindy uses everyday items to build a mini-bulldozer and escape the refrigerator.
    The Amityville Horror – Reverend McFeely tries to bless the house and ends up with flies all over him, only for the scene to change and reveal he is actually straining to defecate into a toilet.
    Buddy hands Cindy a book titled "Harry PotHead", a clear reference to Harry Potter.
    A scene where a basketball falls down the stairs is similar to The Changeling until the scene switches over to a parody of a Nike commercial.[1]
    Dawn of the Dead – Ray has on a suit similar to Peter's SWAT team suit.
    The dialogue between Cindy and Buddy in the freezer, when she is giving him a handjob has been taken from Titanic.
    The use of the quote 'Do You Feel Lucky Punk' from Dwight, is a parody of Dirty Harry.
    Twister – When Cindy is fighting Hanson and creates the tornado, which has various objects and even a cow blowing around inside it.
    Scanners – Hanson's head blows up.
    Rocky – Cindy's fight with the cat (editing style, blows, unseen cameras flashing and the cat's triumphant raising of its "fists").
    Weakest Link – When the parrot says "You are the weakest link. Goodbye" after Tori Spelling's character gets knocked out by the chandelier.
    The skeleton chasing Cindy sequence is based on from Wishmaster.
    The scene with Cindy singing badly along to the radio in the car then getting told to Shut Up by the radio could be a Parody of Urban Legend because the opening featured a woman singing along to the radio badly.
    The scene where Dwight and Hanson are trading insults about each other's disability is based on the scene from Wild Wild West where Jim West and Arliss Loveless trade insults on West's race and Loveless's disability.
    The scene when Cindy is fighting with the cat and the name of the house is from the movie The Legend of Hell House.
    Ray carrying the paraplegic Dwight on his back is reminiscent of Chewbacca attaching the destroyed C-3PO to a harness on his back in The Empire Strikes Back.
